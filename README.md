# Project-Display-Case

# User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

# Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```


# Introduction

This Project will provide a personal landing page for my web development portfolio, a personal Display Case if you will or an electronic one at least.
When visiting this page you will be able to view my up to date resume, a small about me section and of course find a variety of ways to contact me and of course be able to view my completed projects.

## Extra Notes

I tried to keep the html as semantic as possible and css as commented as possible. Both will be updated in the future.
